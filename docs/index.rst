How to Troubleshoot NordPass Extension in Microsoft Edge
==========================================================

If the NordPass extension is not working as expected, follow these troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue.

Update Microsoft Edge
========================

One of the most common reasons extensions stop functioning is outdated browser versions. If you’re using an old version of **Microsoft Edge**, the **NordPass extension** may not work correctly. Here’s how to update Microsoft Edge:

1. Click on the **three dots** (ellipsis) located in the top-right corner of the Edge window.
2. From the dropdown menu, select **Help and feedback**, then click **About Microsoft Edge**.
3. Edge will automatically check for updates. If an update is available, it will be downloaded and installed automatically.
4. Once the update is complete, restart Microsoft Edge and check if the NordPass extension works.

Updating Edge is an essential step because newer versions include security fixes and updates to extension compatibility.

Reinstall the NordPass Extension
===================================

If updating Microsoft Edge didn’t resolve the issue, try reinstalling the **NordPass extension**. Sometimes, corrupted extensions cause problems.

Here’s how to reinstall the NordPass extension:

1. Open **Microsoft Edge** and go to the **Extensions page** by clicking on the **three dots** in the upper-right corner and selecting **Extensions**.
2. Find **NordPass** in the list of extensions and click the **Remove** button next to it.
3. After removing the extension, visit the **Microsoft Edge Add-ons Store** and search for **NordPass**.
4. Click on the **Add to Edge** button to reinstall the extension.
5. Once installed, sign in to your NordPass account and check if the issue is resolved.

Reinstalling the extension helps eliminate any configuration or installation errors that might have occurred initially.

Clear Cache and Cookies in Microsoft Edge
===========================================

If your **NordPass extension** is not syncing or autofilling correctly, it could be due to corrupted cookies or cache data stored by Edge. Clearing this data often resolves such issues.

Follow these steps to clear the cache and cookies in Edge:

1. Open **Microsoft Edge**.
2. Click on the **three dots** in the top-right corner and select **Settings**.
3. From the left sidebar, click **Privacy, search, and services**.
4. Scroll down to the **Clear browsing data** section and click **Choose what to clear**.
5. In the pop-up window, select **Cookies and other site data** and **Cached images and files**.
6. Click the **Clear now** button.

Once the cache and cookies are cleared, restart Edge and check if the NordPass extension is functioning correctly.

Check NordPass Server Status
===============================

Sometimes the issue may not be with your browser or extension but rather with the **NordPass servers**. If NordPass is experiencing an outage or maintenance, the extension may fail to function correctly.

To check the status of NordPass services:

1. Visit the official **NordPass status page** (https://status.nordpass.com).
2. Check if there are any ongoing incidents or maintenance that might be affecting the service.

If NordPass servers are down, you may need to wait for the issue to be resolved.

Disable Conflicting Extensions
=================================

In some cases, other browser extensions may conflict with the **NordPass extension**, preventing it from working correctly. To identify and fix this issue, try disabling other extensions temporarily.

Here’s how you can disable other extensions:

1. Open **Microsoft Edge** and click on the **three dots** in the upper-right corner.
2. Select **Extensions** from the dropdown menu.
3. Toggle off all other extensions except for **NordPass**.
4. Restart Edge and check if NordPass works.

If disabling other extensions resolves the issue, try enabling them one by one to identify the conflicting extension. Once you identify the conflicting extension, you can either disable it permanently or look for an alternative extension.

Reset Microsoft Edge Settings
=================================

If none of the above steps worked, you may want to reset your **Microsoft Edge settings** to their default state. This action will undo any customizations or configurations that might have caused issues with the NordPass extension.

To reset Edge settings:

1. Open **Microsoft Edge** and click on the **three dots** in the top-right corner.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Reset Settings**.
3. Click on **Restore settings to their default values**.
4. Confirm the reset by clicking **Reset**.

Resetting Edge will restore all settings, which can help resolve any conflicts or issues caused by browser customizations.
